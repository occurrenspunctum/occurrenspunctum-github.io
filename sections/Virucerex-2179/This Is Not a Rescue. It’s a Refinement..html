      <p>I have no doubt that the researchers at TrinaNova are brilliant. I am certain that the fungal genome harvested from the Sutian basin was unstable, and that its cryo-binding required elegance. But as someone who has followed Earth‚Äôs pharmaceutical diplomacy across two dozen worlds, I assure you: this cure, Virucerex-2179, was never designed to save Sut.</p>
      <p>It was designed to perfect Earth‚Äôs grip.</p>
      <p>The narrative is familiar by now‚Äîplague is treated as a planetary weakness, biotech becomes the vector of civilisational uplift, and the colony is told to be grateful. But in truth, every molecule of this compound was calibrated for control. The moment of delivery, the price point, the distribution chains‚Äîall of it rehearsed, like a theatre of salvation performed at gunpoint.</p>
      <p>Sut's biology has long been Earth‚Äôs petri dish. What began as opportunistic containment has evolved into a managed dependency so sophisticated, so commercially ornate, that even resistance has become an input variable. The Conglomerates call this ‚Äúresponsive governance.‚Äù I call it what it is: pharmacological feudalism.</p>
      <p>Let‚Äôs speak plainly.</p>
      <p>Virucerex-2179 is not a humanitarian gesture. It is an investment vehicle with antibodies. Its licensing structure is designed to tether planetary clinics to Earth‚Äôs contract cycles for the next thirty years. Its production relies on reagent agents available only through conglomerate-certified suppliers. Its pricing is not indexed to planetary income, but to projected unrest.</p>
      <p>And yet, the celebration continues.</p>
      <p>Newsfeeds run soft-light portraits of beaming researchers. Earth‚Äôs ethic boards pat themselves on the back for approving the cure ‚Äúon schedule.‚Äù Meanwhile, Sutian communities‚Äîsome of whom preserved fungal lineages for generations‚Äîare excluded from production, from royalties, from even naming rights.</p>
      <p>No one is asking the obvious question: what happens when Virucerex stockpiles are withheld? When a rebellion flares in the wrong province? When the next variant emerges, and Earth decides that it is no longer "cost-effective" to adapt the cure?</p>
      <p>As always, the Conglomerate doesn‚Äôt govern through presence. It governs through logistics. It ensures that survival flows through their channels‚Äîand their channels alone.</p>
      <p>So no, this is not a rescue.</p>
      <p>It is a refinement. Of dependency. Of profit. Of colonial grace made palatable through pharmacology.</p>
      <p>And for all the blue in the vial, the real infection remains systemic.</p>
